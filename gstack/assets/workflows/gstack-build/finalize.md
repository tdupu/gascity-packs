Finalize the gstack sprint.

Write a concise sprint report under the build artifact root. Include the
methodology, interaction_mode, review_mode, requirements path, plan path,
decomposition path, implementation summary, review report, QA report, release
readiness report, tests run, changed files, residual risks, and next human
action.

The report should explain that garrytan/gstack role behavior was adapted into
Gas City fanouts and persistent beads. Keep it useful for someone using
automated factories for the first time.

Close with `gc.outcome=pass` and the sprint report path.

Do not invoke provider-native subagents.

Artifact validation: this stage is gated by `.gc/scripts/checks/build-artifact-valid.sh`, which validates the artifact recorded at `gc.build.final_report_path` against schema `gc.build.final-report.v1`. On repair attempts (`gc.attempt` greater than 1), read the validator errors from `gc.attempt_log` on the validation loop control bead (the dependent of this step bead) and repair the artifact in place instead of rewriting it. Two bounded repair attempts follow the first failure; exhausting them closes this stage with `gc.outcome=fail` and machine-readable validation errors that block downstream stages. Never ask questions in headless mode; record unresolved ambiguity inside the artifact.
