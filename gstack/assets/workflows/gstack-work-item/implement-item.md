Implement the assigned gstack shared-drain item.

Gas City owns the shared drain and source-anchor lifecycle. Read only the
assigned item scope, implement the smallest complete change, run focused proof,
and record intended behavior, first verification command, changed files, proof
command, and remaining risks.

Close with `gc.outcome=pass` only after verification.

Do not invoke provider-native subagents. You are the single item lane.

Artifact validation: this step is gated by `.gc/scripts/checks/build-artifact-valid.sh`, which validates the summary recorded at `gc.implementation.summary_path` (fallbacks `gc.build.implementation_summary_path`, then `gc.var.summary_path`) against schema `gc.build.implementation-summary.v1`. On repair attempts (`gc.attempt` greater than 1), read the validator errors from `gc.attempt_log` on the validation loop control bead (the dependent of this step bead) and repair the summary in place instead of rewriting it. Two bounded repair attempts follow the first failure; exhausting them closes this stage with `gc.outcome=fail` and machine-readable validation errors that block downstream stages. Never ask questions in headless mode; record unresolved ambiguity inside the summary.
