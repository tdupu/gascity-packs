# BMAD Pack

This pack implements the Gas City `build-base` workflow contract with vendored
[BMAD Method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) skills.

## What It Provides

- Formula: `bmad-build`
- Vendored skills: `bmad-prd`, `bmad-create-architecture`,
  `bmad-check-implementation-readiness`, `bmad-create-epics-and-stories`,
  `bmad-quick-dev`, `bmad-dev-story`, `bmad-code-review`,
  `bmad-brainstorming`, and `bmad-spec`
- Provenance: `vendor/bmad-method/upstream.toml`

BMAD maps naturally onto the full lifecycle base: PRD, architecture, readiness,
epics/stories, implementation, review, finalize, and publish.

## Import It

Import this pack at city scope. It imports the Gas City pack internally as
`gc`, so `build-base` is available transitively:

```toml
[imports.bmad]
source = "../gascity-packs/bmad"
```

Then launch `bmad-build` from the target rig context. Rig role agents still use
the Gas City `gc.*` override surface.
